         <h3>Hello!<br>
        I'm Gauri</h3>
         <p>Currently pursuing Bachelor's of Design at PES University.<br>
        I'm very much passionate about creating interactive user-interfaces.<br>
    I strongly believe that "Design is intelligence made visible."<br>
I have gathered my experience from the previous semesters and learnt from them.<br>
I look forward in putting my education and acquired skills to use by creating designs that would cater to the user's needs.<br>
I'm very much excited to begin my career in the UI/UX field<br>
         </p>


<p>For a closer look, Please go through MY PORTFOLIO to find out more about my designs and works.<br>
And if you're interested in reaching out to me. I'd love to connect.
